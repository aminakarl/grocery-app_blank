## About Grocery App
You have a GroceryApp class, which receives a list of products, each one with name and votes. The app should render an unordered list, with a list item for each product. Products can be upvoted or downvoted.

By appropriately using React state and props, implement the upvote/downvote logic. Keep the state in the topmost component, while the Product component should accept props.
